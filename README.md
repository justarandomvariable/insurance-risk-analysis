# Insurance Company Financial Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the financial performance of insurance companies using
company-level quarterly data. The focus is on understanding premium structure,
claims behavior, expense management, profitability, and overall operational efficiency.

The analysis is performed using Python with an emphasis on exploratory data analysis
and statistical interpretation.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains financial metrics of insurance companies, including:

- Company name
- Gross Premium
- Net Premium
- Net Premium Earned
- Incurred Claims (Net)
- Commission (Net)
- Management Expenses
- Combined Ratio
- Investment Income
- Profit Before Tax (PBT)
- Profit After Tax (PAT)

All observations are aggregated at the company level.

## Objectives
- Analyze premium and claims structure of insurance companies
- Evaluate operational efficiency using the combined ratio
- Study profitability patterns across firms
- Understand relationships between claims, expenses, and profits

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution and correlation analysis
- Financial ratio interpretation
- Linear regression modeling using scikit-learn
- Statistical reasoning on performance indicators

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit learn
- Statistics

## Key Insights
- Companies with lower combined ratios tend to report stronger profitability
- Claims and management expenses significantly impact net performance
- Investment income plays an important role in overall profitability

## Limitations
- Dataset is aggregated at company level, not policyholder level
- Time-series analysis is limited due to lack of longer historical data

## Future Scope
- Multi-period trend analysis
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics
- Dashboard creation using Power BI
- Predictive modeling for profitability indicators
